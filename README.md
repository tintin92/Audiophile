## Description

An application utilizing TheAudio_DB to allow users to search musical artists and return data such as biographical information, genre, top songs, music videos, and images.

## Features

- When a user searches for a musical artist, they are presented with their top 10 songs
- When a user clicks on any of those songs, song description, genre, and music video will display on the page
- Users will have the option to save the song to their profile in either a "saved songs" list or a "listen to later" list

## Demo

- When a user searches Taylor Swift and clicks on "Blank Space" from the 10 songs list, they will be taken to this page:

## Work in Progress

- When a user arrives at the home page, there is a Genre Playlists section that when a genre is clicked will take the user to a playlist of songs based on that genre. We could incorporate this using the Spotify API.
